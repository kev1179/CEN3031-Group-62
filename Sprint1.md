# Issues
* Validating inputs when registering
* Storing more user data
* Implementing live reloading for back-end
* Fixing links on homepage
* Adding color scheme
* Integrating login status on front-end
* Implementing multiple pages
* Completing the user registration system

So far, we were only able to complete the user registration system and have multiple pages implemented.

## Issues to be completed
***Validating inputs when registering:*** While we have already developed our website to check for duplicate usernames and a correct email format, we still need to implement password requirements such as character constraints (ex: no illegal characters) and minimum password length.

***Storing more user data:*** We want to add more attributes that can be used to store additional data of a user into our database, but we are still deciding on what they will be.

***Implementing live reloading for back-end:*** We want to be able to make and save changes to our code without having to rerun the server, but we will encode this feature into our program after fixing other issues as this issue is relatively easy to fix.

***Fixing links on homepage:*** We have not yet developed pages for some links in the homepage.

***Adding color scheme:*** We will work on adding color after deciding on the final structure and implementation of our website.

***Integrating login status on front-end:*** We have not yet touched on this issue, but we will start working on it after fixing other issues.
